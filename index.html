  <img src="assets/about-me-photo.jpeg">
  <p>I’m an enthusiastic tech geek always looking for new ways to improve people’s lives. I first started programming as
    a kid, making game mods and tinkering with early Linux distributions. Inspired by the craftsmanship of John Carmack
    and others, I have kept that early joy, insatiable curiosity, and constant need to experiment. I love to dive deep
    into new technologies and find simpler ways of solving problems. I am happiest when collaborating to produce
    enduring quality that others can depend upon. Over time, this pattern has given me a generalist’s skillset: the
    flexibility to shift into different roles and the breadth to connect to details that are important to diverse
    perspectives across an organization. I’m also passionate about collaboration and the quiet ways that organizations
    can influence the innovation, communication, and happiness of their people.</p>
